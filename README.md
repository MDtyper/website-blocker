# "Website Silencer"

A python script to block certain websites using the hosts file. 

## First things first
To run the program, change the file path of the website.txt. If you are not on Windows the hosts file path will also need to be changed.
Once the paths are changed, simply run the main() file.

## How to use?
Using the Tkinter library a simple GUI is shown and allows for the simple adding and removal of website links.

To "block" a website, insert the website inside the entry and press the Block button or simply press Enter. The website will be added to the hosts file and will be shown within the gui.

to "remove" a website, select the row inside the GUI you want to remove and press the Unlock button or press the "delete" key.
